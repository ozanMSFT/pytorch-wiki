<!-- TODO: When should we use build/install instead of develop? -->

## Install from Source
Now that you have the source code, you can build PyTorch on your development machine. Note that the steps might be different depending on your machine's platform.

The `setup.py` script is configurable via build flags and environment variables; take a look at [Development-Tips] for details.

### MacOS

```bash
python3 setup.py develop
```

### Linux

If you would like to compile PyTorch with [new C++ ABI](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/libstdc++/manual/using_dual_abi.html) enabled, then first run this command:
```bash
export _GLIBCXX_USE_CXX11_ABI=1
```

If you're compiling for AMD ROCm then first run this command:
```bash
# Only run this if you're compiling for ROCm
python tools/amd_build/build_amd.py
```

Install PyTorch
```bash
export CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=${CONDA_PREFIX:-"$(dirname $(which conda))/../"}
python setup.py develop
```

> _Aside:_ If you are using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#download-section), you may experience an error caused by the linker:
>
> ```plaintext
> build/temp.linux-x86_64-3.7/torch/csrc/stub.o: file not recognized: file format not recognized
> collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status
> error: command 'g++' failed with exit status 1
> ```
>
> This is caused by `ld` from the Conda environment shadowing the system `ld`. You should use a newer version of Python that fixes this issue. The recommended Python version is 3.8.1+.


### Windows

#### Choose Correct Visual Studio Version.

PyTorch CI uses Visual C++ BuildTools, which come with Visual Studio Enterprise,
Professional, or Community Editions. You can also install the build tools from
https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/. The build tools *do not*
come with Visual Studio Code by default.

If you want to build legacy python code, please refer to [Building on legacy code and CUDA](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#building-on-legacy-code-and-cuda)


#### CPU-only builds

In this mode PyTorch computations will run on your CPU, not your GPU

```cmd
conda activate
python setup.py develop
```

Note on OpenMP: The desired OpenMP implementation is Intel OpenMP (iomp). In order to link against iomp, you'll need to manually download the library and set up the building environment by tweaking `CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH` and `LIB`. The instruction [here](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/docs/source/notes/windows.rst#building-from-source) is an example for setting up both MKL and Intel OpenMP. Without these configurations for CMake, Microsoft Visual C OpenMP runtime (vcomp) will be used.


#### CUDA based build

In this mode PyTorch computations will leverage your GPU via CUDA for faster number crunching

[NVTX](https://docs.nvidia.com/gameworks/content/gameworkslibrary/nvtx/nvidia_tools_extension_library_nvtx.htm) is needed to build Pytorch with CUDA.
NVTX is a part of CUDA distributive, where it is called "Nsight Compute". To install it onto an already installed CUDA run CUDA installation once again and check the corresponding checkbox.
Make sure that CUDA with Nsight Compute is installed after Visual Studio.

Currently, VS 2017 / 2019, and Ninja are supported as the generator of CMake. If `ninja.exe` is detected in `PATH`, then Ninja will be used as the default generator, otherwise, it will use VS 2017 / 2019.
<br/> If Ninja is selected as the generator, the latest MSVC will get selected as the underlying toolchain.

Additional libraries such as
[Magma](https://developer.nvidia.com/magma), [oneDNN, a.k.a. MKLDNN or DNNL](https://github.com/oneapi-src/oneDNN), and [Sccache](https://github.com/mozilla/sccache) are often needed. Please refer to the [installation-helper](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/tree/main/.ci/pytorch/win-test-helpers/installation-helpers) to install them.

You can refer to the [build_pytorch.bat](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/.ci/pytorch/win-test-helpers/build_pytorch.bat) script for some other environment variables configurations



```cmd
cmd

:: Set the environment variables after you have downloaded and unzipped the mkl package,
:: else CMake would throw an error as `Could NOT find OpenMP`.
set CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH={Your directory}\mkl\include
set LIB={Your directory}\mkl\lib;%LIB%

:: Read the content in the previous section carefully before you proceed.
:: [Optional] If you want to override the underlying toolset used by Ninja and Visual Studio with CUDA, please run the following script block.
:: "Visual Studio 2019 Developer Command Prompt" will be run automatically.
:: Make sure you have CMake >= 3.12 before you do this when you use the Visual Studio generator.
set CMAKE_GENERATOR_TOOLSET_VERSION=14.27
set DISTUTILS_USE_SDK=1
for /f "usebackq tokens=*" %i in (`"%ProgramFiles(x86)%\Microsoft Visual Studio\Installer\vswhere.exe" -version [15^,17^) -products * -latest -property installationPath`) do call "%i\VC\Auxiliary\Build\vcvarsall.bat" x64 -vcvars_ver=%CMAKE_GENERATOR_TOOLSET_VERSION%

:: [Optional] If you want to override the CUDA host compiler
set CUDAHOSTCXX=C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2019\Community\VC\Tools\MSVC\14.27.29110\bin\HostX64\x64\cl.exe

python setup.py develop

```

If you are building for NVIDIA's Jetson platforms (Jetson Nano, TX1, TX2, AGX Xavier), Instructions to install PyTorch for Jetson Nano are [available here](https://devtalk.nvidia.com/default/topic/1049071/jetson-nano/pytorch-for-jetson-nano/)

## Reinstalling PyTorch
Make sure you uninstall PyTorch first by running `pip uninstall torch` (you may need to run this multiple times to fully uninstall `torch`) and `python setup.py clean`. Then you can reinstall by running `python setup.py develop` again.
