## What is nn?
The `torch.nn` library is the component of PyTorch that provides building blocks for neural networks. Its core abstraction is `nn.Module`, which encapsulates stateful computation with learnable parameters. Modules integrate with the [[autograd|Autograd-Basics]] system and are generally trained using optimizers provided in [`torch.optim`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/optim.html).
