## Scope
* Understand what vmap is
* Understand how vmap is implemented with Tensor Subclassing
* Understand (as a PyTorch developer) how to add missing support for an operation with vmap

## Introduction to vmap

Read through [the functorch whirlwind tour](https://pytorch.org/functorch/stable/notebooks/whirlwind_tour.html).

## How to add vmap support for a PyTorch operator

Read through https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/master/functorch/writing_batching_rules.md
