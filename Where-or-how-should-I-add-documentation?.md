[[Page Maintainers|How to add a new page, edit a page, or suggest edits]]: @zou3519

## Goals

The [PyTorch Developer Wiki](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/wiki/) is the home for developer-facing PyTorch documentation. User-facing documentation goes on [pytorch.org/docs](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/index.html).

Documentation can easily go out of date. This page is meant to be a guide to best practices for adding new pages, editing a page, or suggesting edits to a page to help keep the documents up-to-date.

## Adding a new page

Each page should have a "Page Maintainers: " section at a very top that lists the GitHub handles of folks responsible for maintaining the page. *Maintainers* are responsible for keeping the pages up to date.

## A page looks out of date, what do I do?

* For small changes, feel free to fix it yourself.
* For larger changes, or if you're not sure how to correct something, open a GitHub issue and assign it to the maintainers.
