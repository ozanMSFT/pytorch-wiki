* Understand what views are
* Understand how to author an operator in PyTorch
* Understand how to test operators in PyTorch
* Understand what TensorIterator is


## What is a Tensor?

A Tensor [consists of](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/2d6fd22e241763da67e8076a8d3443d988215f32/c10/core/TensorImpl.cpp#L84-L90):

* data_ptr, a pointer to a chunk of memory
* some *sizes* metadata
* some *strides* metadata
* a storage offset
