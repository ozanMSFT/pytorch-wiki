- Developer Experience: How easy it is to develop, get signal, and reviews for Pytorch
- Green HUD: Keeping the workflows that run on master and nightly green.
- CI Infrastructure: Ensuring that jobs get run in a timely and reliable manner.
- General CI Questions: How to add CI workflows, debugging CI, etc.

If you have any questions or requests related to these initiatives please join our Office Hours!  We would love to hear from you!
